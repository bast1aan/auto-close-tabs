<b>Note:</b>
After installation, the addon is initally paused and does nothing, so one can
modify the preferences to their requirements, without having to worry about
losing any tabs. Afterwards the addon can be activated on a per window basis, by
clicking on the toolbar button. The button allows to quickly change if a
window should be included or excluded from the cleanup cycle. Please note, that
after a browser restart no window is initally part of the cleanup cycle,
meaning, the addon will always be inactive.

<b>Usage:</b>
<ol>
  <li>install the add-on</li>
  <li>change the preferences of the addons to your requirements</li>
  <li>
    click the toolbar button inside the browser windows, you want to monitor
  </li>
</ol>
